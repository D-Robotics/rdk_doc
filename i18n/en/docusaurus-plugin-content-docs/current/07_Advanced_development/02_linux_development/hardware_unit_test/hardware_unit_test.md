# 6.3 Hardware Unit Testing
This chapter introduces how to perform hardware unit testing for X3. Please download the program and script required from [here](http://sunrise.horizon.cc/downloads/unittest/sample_base_test.tar.gz).
### Instructions for using the testing program
1. Upload `sample_base_test.tar.gz` to the X3 board. It is recommended to place it in the `/userdate` or `/app` directory.
2. Go to the directory where `sample_base_test.tar.gz` is located and extract the testing program by running `tar -xvf sample_base_test.tar.gz`.
### Disclaimer
**The programs and scripts provided in this testing solution may not necessarily be the best choice. Different hardware designs and different peripheral configurations may cause this testing method to fail or result in significant differences between the tested data and target values. It is recommended to have patience and conduct debugging verification.**
