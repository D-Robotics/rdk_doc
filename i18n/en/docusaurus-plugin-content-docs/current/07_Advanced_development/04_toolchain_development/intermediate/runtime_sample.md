# On-board Model Application Development Guide

## Model Inference DNN API Usage Example

### Overview

This section introduces the specific usage of the horizon_runtime_sample package for on-board model application development. Developers can experience and develop applications based on these examples to lower the development threshold.

The sample package provides three types of examples:

- Model inference DNN API usage examples
- Special features examples such as custom operators (custom OP)
- Miscellaneous examples for non-NV12 input models

Please read on for more details.

:::tip Tip

To obtain the horizon_runtime_sample package, please refer to the [Deliverables Instructions](../intermediate/environment_config.md).

:::

### Environment Building

#### Development Board Preparation

1. After receiving the development board, please update the development board image to the latest version. For the upgrade method, please refer to the [**System Update**](../../../01_Quick_start/install_os.md#flash_system) chapter.

2. Ensure that the local development machine and the development board can be connected remotely.

#### Compilation

Compilation requires the installation of cross-compilation tools: ``aarch64-linux-gnu-g++``, ``aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc``. Please use the D-Robotics provided development machine Docker image for compilation directly. Please read the [**Environment Installation**](../intermediate/environment_config.md) chapter for obtaining and using the development machine Docker environment;
According to the situation of the development board used, please use the ``build_xj3.sh`` or ``build_ultra.sh`` script under the horizon_runtime_sample/code directory to compile the executable program in the development board environment with one click. The executable program and corresponding dependencies will be automatically copied to the ``xj3/script`` directory under the ``aarch64`` directory or the ``ultra/script`` directory under the ``aarch64`` directory.

:::info Note
  The project specifies the path of the cross-compilation tool by obtaining the environment variable ``LINARO_GCC_ROOT``, users can check whether the local environment variable is the target cross-compilation tool before use.
  If you need to specify the path of the cross-compilation tool, you can set the environment variable ``LINARO_GCC_ROOT``, or directly modify the script ``build_xj3.sh`` or ``build_ultra.sh``, specify the variables ``CC`` and ``CXX``.
:::

```shell
  export CC=${GCC_ROOT}/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc
  export CXX=${GCC_ROOT}/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-g++
```

### Example Usage

## Public model performance accuracy evaluation instructions

### Public model performance accuracy indicatorsThe table below provides performance and accuracy indicators of typical deep neural network models on the X3 processor.

![model_accuracy](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/07_Advanced_development/04_toolchain_development/intermediate/model_accuracy.png)

:::caution Note:

1. The data in the table are measured results on the D-Robotics RDK X3 development board, and the test models are from the horizon_model_convert_sample model example package.

2. For the BPU/CPU hybrid heterogeneous models in the model example package, the frame consumption time is mainly composed of the input quantization CPU node, model BPU operators, model CPU operators, output dequantization CPU node, CPU post-processing, etc. The specific explanation is as follows:

   a. Input quantization CPU node: completes the float32 to int8 input quantization operation, which is only included in models that use featuremap input. The quantization time is proportional to the input shape size.

   b. Model CPU operators:
   
        i. Any CPU operators not included in the detection model.
        
        ii. The Softmax and Reshape at the tail of the classification model are CPU operators.
        
        iii. The Argmax at the tail of the segmentation model DeepLabV3+ is a CPU operator.

   c. Output dequantization CPU node: completes the int8 to float32 output dequantization operation. The quantization time is proportional to the output shape size.

   d. D-Robotics currently supports manually removing the quantization/dequantization nodes of a model and integrating them into pre- and post-processing code by users to reduce the overhead of duplicate data traversal. Taking the EfficientDet model as an example, after removing the dequantization node and incorporating it into the post-processing, the inference performance is improved from 66 FPS to 100 FPS.

   e. Currently, the post-processing of the D-Robotics sample models has not been specifically optimized for performance. You can use optimization methods such as approximate and efficient implementation according to your actual needs to accelerate the code at the code level.

3. In practical applications, the BPU and CPU can run concurrently to improve the overall inference speed.

4. If the measured performance is inconsistent with the test results in the table above, several factors may cause this situation:

   a. The impact of DDR bandwidth, the development board can only run the ai_benchmark program.

   b. The algorithm toolchain version does not exactly match the system image version. The ideal scenario is to use the algorithm toolchain and system image released together.

   c. The impact of CPU frequency reduction, currently the development board enables automatic frequency reduction by default after reboot. To achieve the best performance, you need to execute the command to disable frequency reduction on the development board: `echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_governor`.

#### Evaluation Example Usage Instructions

The evaluation example scripts are mainly located in the `script` and `tools` directories. The `script` directory contains evaluation scripts that run on the development board, including common classification, detection, and segmentation models. Each model has three scripts, which represent:

- fps.sh: Uses multi-threading scheduling to calculate frames per second (FPS). Users can freely set the number of threads according to their requirements.
- latency.sh: Calculates the latency of a single frame (one thread, one frame).
- accuracy.sh: Used for accuracy evaluation.

:::caution Note

The following examples are based on the testing results of the **RDK X3** development board. If using the **RDK Ultra** development board, there may be differences in information. Please refer to the specific testing results.

#### Accuracy Evaluation

The accuracy evaluation of the model consists of four steps:

1. Data preprocessing.
2. Data loading.
3. Model inference.
4. Accuracy calculation.

- #### Data Preprocessing`{#data_preprocess}`

For PTQ models: Data preprocessing needs to be performed on an x86 development machine using the "hb_eval_preprocess" tool to preprocess the dataset.
Data preprocessing refers to specific operations performed on image data before feeding it into the model, such as image resizing, cropping, and padding.
This tool is integrated into the environment of the model conversion and compilation on the development machine. After the original dataset is preprocessed using this tool, it will generate a corresponding preprocessing binary file (.bin file) for the model.
Running "hb_eval_preprocess --help" directly will display the usage rules of this tool.

:::tip Tips

1. To learn about the command-line parameters of the "hb_eval_preprocess" tool, you can enter "hb_eval_preprocess -h" or refer to the section [**hb_eval_preprocess Tool**](../intermediate/ptq_process.md) for an explanation of PTQ quantization principles and steps.
:::

Next, we will provide a detailed introduction to the dataset corresponding to each model in the example package and the preprocessing operations for the corresponding dataset:

- "VOC dataset": This dataset is mainly used for evaluating the ssd_mobilenetv1 model.
  Its directory structure is as follows, and the example mainly uses the val.txt file under "Main", source images under "JPEGImages", and annotation data under "Annotations":

```shell
  .
  └── VOCdevkit                  # Root directory
      └── VOC2012                # Datasets of different years, only 2012 is downloaded here, there are other years like 2007 as well
          ├── Annotations        # Stores XML files, each corresponding to a image in JPEGImages, explains the content of the image, etc.
          ├── ImageSets          # This directory stores text files, and each line in the text file contains the name of an image, followed by ±1 indicating positive or negative samples
          │   ├── Action
          │   ├── Layout
          │   ├── Main
          │   └── Segmentation
          ├── JPEGImages         # Stores source images
          ├── SegmentationClass  # Stores images related to semantic segmentation
          └── SegmentationObject # Stores images related to instance segmentation
```

Perform data preprocessing on the dataset:

```bash
  hb_eval_preprocess -m ssd_mobilenetv1 -i VOCdevkit/VOC2012/JPEGImages -v VOCdevkit/VOC2012/ImageSets/Main/val.txt -o ./pre_ssd_mobilenetv1
```
- "COCO dataset": This dataset is mainly used for evaluating detection models such as yolov2_darknet19, yolov3_darknet53, yolov5s, efficientdetd0, fcos_efficientnetb0, and centernet_resnet50, etc.The directory structure is as follows, and the example mainly uses the "instances_val2017.json" annotation file in the "annotations" folder and the images in the "images" folder:

```shell
  .
  ├── annotations    # stores annotation data
  └── images         # stores source images
```

Preprocess the dataset:

```bash
  hb_eval_preprocess -m model_name -i coco/coco_val2017/images -o ./pre_model_name
```

- "ImageNet dataset": This dataset is mainly used for the evaluation of classification models such as EfficientNet_lite0, EfficientNet_Lite1, EfficientNet_Lite2, EfficientNet_Lite3, EfficientNet_Lite4, MobileNet, GoogleNet, ResNet, etc. In the example, the "val.txt" annotation file and the source images in the "val" directory are mainly used.

```shell
  .
  ├── val.txt
  └── val
```

Preprocess the dataset:

```bash
  hb_eval_preprocess -m model_name -i imagenet/val -o ./pre_model_name
```

- "Cityscapes dataset": This dataset is used for the evaluation of segmentation models such as deeplabv3plus_efficientnetb0, deeplabv3plus_efficientnetm1, deeplabv3plus_efficientnetm2, fastscnn_efficientnetb0, etc. In the example, the annotation files in "./gtFine/val" and the source images in "./leftImg8bit/val" are mainly used.

```shell
  .
  ├── gtFine
  │   └── val
  │       ├── frankfurt
  │       ├── lindau
  │       └── munster
  └── leftImg8bit
      └── val
          ├── frankfurt
          ├── lindau
          └── munster
```

Preprocess the dataset:

```bash
  hb_eval_preprocess -m unet_mobilenet -i cityscapes/leftImg8bit/val -o ./pre_unet_mobilenet
```

The workflow for running the accuracy calculation script in the example is:1. According to the value of the "image_list_file" parameter in "workflow_accurary.json", search for the corresponding "lst" file of the dataset.

2. Load each pre-processing file according to the preprocessing file path information stored in the "lst" file, and then perform inference.

Therefore, after generating the pre-processing file, it is necessary to generate the corresponding lst file and write the path of each pre-processing file into the lst file, which is related to the storage location of the dataset on the development board.
Here we recommend placing it in the same directory as the "script" folder, as follows:

```bash

  # For RDK X3, use the following format:
  |-- ptq
  |   |-- data
  |   |   |-- cityscapes
  |   |   |   -- xxxx.bin             # Pre-processed binary file

  |   |   |   |-- pre_ssd_mobilenetv1.lst
  |-- model
  |   |-- ...
  |-- script
  |   |-- ...

```
To generate the corresponding lst files, refer to the following method:

```shell

  # For RDK X3, please use the following command:
  find ../../../data/coco/fcos -name "*bin*" > ../../../data/coco/coco.lst# RDK Ultra Please use the following command:
  find ../../../data/coco/pre_centernet_resnet101 -name "*bin*" > ../../../data/coco/pre_centernet_resnet101.lst

```

The generated `lst` file stores a relative path: `../../../data/` or `../../../data/coco/pre_centernet_resnet101/`, which can match the default configuration path of `workflow_accuracy.json`.
If you need to change the storage location of the pre-processing dataset, make sure that the corresponding `lst` file can be read by `workflow_accuracy.json`. Secondly, ensure that the program can read the corresponding pre-processing file based on the path information in `lst`.

- #### Data Mounting

Since the dataset is relatively large and not suitable to be placed directly on the development board, it can be mounted via nfs for the board to read.

Host PC (requires root permission):

1. Edit /etc/exports and add a line:
   `/nfs *(insecure,rw,sync,all_squash,anonuid=1000,anongid=1000,no_subtree_check)`.
   `/nfs` represents the mount path on the local machine, which can be replaced with a user-specified directory.
2. Execute the command `exportfs -a -r` to make /etc/exports take effect.

Board Side:

1. Create the directory to be mounted: `mkdir -p /mnt`.
2. `mount -t nfs {PC IP}:/nfs /mnt -o nolock`.

The /nfs folder on the PC side is mounted to the /mnt folder on the board side. In this way, mount the folder containing the pre-processing data to the board side, and create a soft link from the /data directory to the /ptq directory on the board side, which is at the same level as the /script directory.

#### Model Integration

Model post-processing integration mainly consists of 2 steps, taking centernet_resnet50 model integration as an example:

1. Add the post-processing file `ptq_centernet_post_process_method.cc` and the header file `ptq_centernet_post_process_method.h`.
2. Add the model execution script and configuration file.

#### Adding Post-processing Files

:::caution Note

  The following example is based on the RDK X3 development board. If you are using the RDK Ultra development board, the information may vary. Please refer to the specific instructions.
:::

The post-processing code file can be directly reused from any post-processing file in the src/method directory. The main modifications are the `InitFromJsonString` function and the `PostProcess` function.

The `InitFromJsonString` function is mainly used to read the post-processing related parameter configurations from the workflow.json file. Users can customize the input parameters accordingly.
The `PostProcess` function completes the logic of post-processing.

The .cc file should be placed in the `ai_benchmark/code/src/method/` path,
The .h header file should be placed in the `ai_benchmark/code/include/method/` path:

```bash
  |--ai_benchmark
  |  |--code                                                 # Example source code
  |  |  |--include
  |  |  |  |--method                                         # Add header files in this folder
  |  |  |  |  |--ptq_centernet_post_process_method.h
  |  |  |  |  |--......
|--ptq_yolo5_post_process_method.h
  |--src
  |  |--method                                         # Add post-processing .cc files in this folder
  |  |  |--ptq_centernet_post_process_method.cc
  |  |  |  |--......
  |  |  |  |--ptq_yolo5_post_process_method.cc
```
#### Add model running scripts and configuration files

The directory structure of the scripts is as follows:

```bash
|--ai_benchmark
  |--xj3/ptq/script                                      # Example script folder
  |  |--detection
  |  |  |--centernet_resnet50
  |  |  |  |--accuracy.sh                                # Accuracy testing script
  |  |  |  |--fps.sh                                     # Performance testing script
  |  |  |  |--latency.sh                                 # Single frame latency example script
  |  |  |  |--workflow_accuracy.json                     # Accuracy configuration file
  |  |  |  |--workflow_fps.json                          # Performance configuration file
  |  |  |  |--workflow_latency.json                      # Single frame latency configuration file
```

#### Auxiliary tools and common operations

#### Instructions for using the logging system

The logging system mainly includes "sample logs" and "model inference API DNN logs".
The sample logs refer to the application logs in the delivery package.
Users can obtain different logs based on their needs.

- Sample logs

1. Log levels. Sample logs mainly use vlog from glog, and there are four custom levels:

  - "0" (SYSTEM), which is mainly used to output error messages;
  - "1" (REPORT), which is mainly used in the sample code to output performance data;
  - "2" (DETAIL), which is mainly used in the sample code to output system status information;
  - "3" (DEBUG), which is mainly used in the sample code to output debug information.
    Logging level setting rules: Suppose the level is set to "P", if there is a level "Q" lower than "P",
    it can be enabled, or else it will be suppressed; DEBUG>DETAIL>REPORT>SYSTEM by default.

2. Log level setting. Set the log level through the "log_level" parameter. When running the sample, specify the "log_level" parameter to set the level.
   For example, specifying "log_level=0" outputs SYSTEM logs; if specifying "log_level=3",
   it outputs DEBUG, DETAIL, REPORT, and SYSTEM logs.

- Model inference API DNN logs

For the configuration of model inference DNN API logs, please refer to the "Configuration Information" section in the [Model Inference DNN API Usage Guide](../../../04_Algorithm_Application/02_cdev_dnn_api/cdev_dnn_api.md).#### Operator Time Explanation


The statistics on the performance of the model operators (OP) are achieved by setting the environment variable ``HB_DNN_PROFILER_LOG_PATH``. This section introduces the performance analysis of the model's inference, which helps developers to understand the real inference performance of the model.
The type and value of this variable are described as follows:

:::info Note

  ``export HB_DNN_PROFILER_LOG_PATH=${path}``: represents the output path where the dumped OP nodes are located. After the program runs normally and exits, a profiler.log file will be generated.
:::
- Example Explanation

:::caution Note

  The following example uses **RDK X3** development board as an example. If using **RDK Ultra** development board, there may be differences in the information. Please refer to the specific board used!

```


The above output shows the "model_latency" and "task_latency". The "model_latency" outputs the time consumption for each OP in the model, while the "task_latency" outputs the time consumption for each task module in the model.

:::info Note

- The profiler.log file will only be generated if the program exits normally.
:::

#### Dump Tool

This section mainly introduces the method of enabling the dump tool. Generally, it is not necessary to pay attention to it. The dump tool is only used when the model accuracy is abnormal.
By setting the environment variable `export HB_DNN_DUMP_PATH=${path}`, the input and output of each node in the model inference process can be dumped. Based on the dumped output, it is possible to check whether there are consistency issues between the model inference on the development machine simulator and the development board: that is, whether the outputs of the same model and the same input on the development machine simulator and the development board are exactly the same.

## Instructions for Model-on-Board Analysis Tool

### Overview

This section introduces a fast verification tool for model inference on D-Robotics Algorithm Toolchain. This tool allows developers to quickly obtain information about the "xxx.bin" model, model inference performance, and model debugging.

### Instructions for hrt_model_exec Tool

The "hrt_model_exec" tool allows for quickly evaluating model inference performance and obtaining model information on the development board.

Currently, the tool provides three types of functions, as shown in the table below:

  | **Number** | **Subcommand**     | **Description** |
  |----------|------|-----|
  | 1        | "model_info" | Get model information, such as input-output information of the model. |
  | 2        | "infer"      | Perform model inference and obtain the inference results.         |
  | 3        | "perf"       | Perform model performance analysis and obtain the performance analysis results.     |


:::tip Tips

  The tool can also check the version of the "dnn" prediction library using the "-v" or "--version" command.

  For example: hrt_model_exec -v or hrt_model_exec --version
:::

#### Instructions

This section describes the specific usage of the three subfunctions of the ``hrt_model_exec`` tool.

#### ``model_info``

- Overview

This parameter is used to obtain model information. The supported models are QAT models and PTQ models.
This parameter is used together with ``model_file`` to obtain detailed information about the model;
The model information includes the model's input and output information ``hbDNNTensorProperties`` and the model's segment information ``stage``; The model's segment information is: a picture can be inferred in multiple stages. The stage information is [x1, y1, x2, y2], which are the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corners of the picture inference. Currently, D-Robotics RDK Ultra's Bayes architecture supports inference of such segmented models, and the models on RDK X3 are all 1-stage models.

:::tip Tips

If ``model_name`` is not specified, all model information in the model will be output. If ``model_name`` is specified, only the information of the corresponding model will be output.
:::
- Example

1. Single model
```
  hrt_model_exec model_info --model_file=xxx.bin
```
2. Multiple models (output all model information)
```
  hrt_model_exec model_info --model_file=xxx.bin,xxx.bin  
```
3. Multiple models - pack model (output specific model information)
```
  hrt_model_exec model_info --model_file=xxx.bin --model_name=xx
```
![model_info](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/07_Advanced_development/04_toolchain_development/intermediate/model_info.png)


#### Supplementary Explanation of Input Parameters

- Repeat Input

If the same parameter input is specified repeatedly, the parameters will be overwritten. For example, when obtaining model information, if two model files are specified repeatedly, the later parameter input ``yyy.bin`` will be used:
```
  hrt_model_exec model_info --model_file=xxx.bin --model_file=yyy.bin
```
If input is repeated without adding the command line parameter ``--model_file``, the value after the command line parameter will be used, and parameters without arguments will not be recognized. For example, in the following example, ``yyy.bin`` will be ignored and the parameter value will be ``xxx.bin``:
```
  hrt_model_exec model_info --model_file=xxx.bin yyy.bin
```

#### ``infer``

- Overview

This parameter is used to input a custom image, and the model infers one frame and provides the inference result.
This parameter needs to be used together with ``input_file`` to specify the input image path. The tool resizes the image and organizes the model input information based on the model information.

:::tip Tip

The program runs single-threaded to process one frame of data and outputs the time it takes for the model to run.
:::
- Example Explanation

1. Single Model
```
  hrt_model_exec infer --model_file=xxx.bin --input_file=xxx.jpg
```
2. Multi Model
```
  hrt_model_exec infer --model_file=xxx.bin,xxx.bin --model_name=xx --input_file=xxx.jpg
```

The ``infer`` function of the tool supports the inference of multi-input models, supports image input, binary file input, and text file input, and the input data is separated by commas.
The input information of the model can be viewed through ``model_info``.

```
hrt_model_exec infer --model_file=xxx.bin --input_file=xxx.jpg,input.txt
```

#### `Supplementary Explanation of Input Parameters`

- `input_file`

For image type input, the file name extension must be one of the following: `bin` / `JPG` / `JPEG` / `jpg` / `jpeg`. For feature input, the file name extension must be one of the following: `bin` / `txt`. Each input file needs to be separated by a comma. For example: `xxx.jpg,input.txt`.

- `enable_cls_post_process`

Enable classification post-processing. It is only supported in PTQ classification models. When the sub-command is `infer`, the variable should be set to `true` to print the classification results. Refer to the following figure:

![enable_cls_post_process](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/07_Advanced_development/04_toolchain_development/intermediate/enable_cls_post_process.png)

- `roi_infer`

If the model contains a resizer input source, both `infer` and `perf` functions need to set `roi_infer` to true, and configure the `input_file` and `roi` parameters corresponding to the input source. For example, if the model has three inputs with the input source order of [`ddr`, `resizer`, `resizer`], the command line for inferring two sets of input data is as follows:

```
  // infer
  hrt_model_exec infer --model_file=xxx.bin --input_file="xx0.bin,xx1.jpg,xx2.jpg,xx3.bin,xx4.jpg,xx5.jpg"  --roi="2,4,123,125;6,8,111,113;27,46,143,195;16,28,131,183" 
  // perf
  hrt_model_exec perf --model_file=xxx.bin --input_file="xx0.bin,xx1.jpg,xx2.jpg,xx3.bin,xx4.jpg,xx5.jpg"   --roi="2,4,123,125;6,8,111,113;27,46,143,195;16,28,131,183"
```

Each `roi` input needs to be separated by a semicolon.

- `dump_intermediate`

Dump the input data and output data of each layer node in the model. When `dump_intermediate=0`, the default dump function is turned off. When `dump_intermediate=1`, the input data and output data of each layer node in the model are saved in `bin` format, and the output of `BPU` node is saved as `aligned` data. When `dump_intermediate=2`, the input data and output data of each layer node in the model are saved in both `bin` and `txt` formats, and the output of `BPU` node is saved as `aligned` data. When `dump_intermediate=3`, the input data and output data of each layer node in the model are saved in both `bin` and `txt` formats, and the output of `BPU` node is saved as `valid` data. For example, if the model has two inputs with the input source order of [`pyramid`, `ddr`], and the input and output of each layer node in the model are saved as `bin` files, and the output of `BPU` node is saved as `aligned` type, the inference command line is as follows:

```
  hrt_model_exec infer --model_file=xxx.bin --input_file="xx0.jpg,xx1.bin"  --dump_intermediate=1
```

The `dump_intermediate` parameter supports both `infer` and `perf` modes.

- `hybrid_dequantize_process`

Control the float type output data in txt format. The `hybrid_dequantize_process` parameter is effective when `enable_dump=true`. When `enable_dump=true`, if `hybrid_dequantize_process=true` is set, the integer output data is dequantized, and all outputs are saved as `txt` files in float format. The output of the model is `valid` data, and it supports configuring `dump_txt_axis` and `dump_precision`. If `hybrid_dequantize_process=false` is set, the `aligned` data of the model output is directly saved without any processing. For example, if the model has three outputs with the order of tensor data types as [`float`, `int32`, `int16`], and the `valid` data of float type in txt format is output, the inference command line is as follows:

```
   hrt_model_exec infer --model_file=xxx.bin --input_file="xx0.jpg,xx1.bin"  --dump_intermediate=1
```
The `dump_intermediate` parameter supports both `infer` and `perf` modes.// Output float type data
hrt_model_exec infer --model_file=xxx.bin --input_file="xx.bin" --enable_dump=true --hybrid_dequantize_process=true


``hybrid_dequantize_process`` parameter currently only supports four-dimensional models.

#### ``perf``
- Overview

This parameter is used to test the inference performance of the model. 
With this command tool, users do not need to input data. The program will automatically construct the input tensor of the model based on the model information, and the tensor data will be random.
The program runs with a default single thread and 200 frames of data. When the perf_time parameter is specified, the frame_count parameter is invalid, and the program will exit after executing for the specified time.
After the program completes, it will output the number of program threads, frame count, total model inference time, average model inference latency, frame rate information, etc.

:::tip Tips

The program prints performance information every 200 frames: maximum, minimum, and average values of latency. When the number of frames is less than 200, the program prints once after the program finishes running.
:::

- Example

1. Single model
```
hrt_model_exec perf --model_file=xxx.bin
```
2. Multiple models
```
hrt_model_exec perf --model_file=xxx.bin,xxx.bin --model_name=xx
```

#### ``Multi-thread Latency Data Explanation``

The purpose of multiple threads is to fully utilize BPU resources. Multiple threads process ``frame_count`` frames or execute for perf_time until data processing is completed/execution time ends and the program terminates.
In the multi-thread ``perf`` process, you can execute the following command to obtain the real-time occupancy of BPU resources.

```bash
hrut_somstatus -n 10000 -d 1
```

Output:

```bash
=====================1=====================

        bpu1: 400000000 1000000000      1000000000      0
```

:::info Remarks

The above example shows the output log of the **RDK X3** development board. If using the **RDK Ultra** development board, simply use the above command to obtain the output.
In "perf" mode, the latency measurement of a single thread represents the actual on-board performance of the model, while the latency data of multiple threads represents the processing time of each thread per frame, which is longer than that of a single thread. However, the overall processing time of multiple threads is reduced, and the frame rate is improved.

#### Supplementary explanation of input parameters

- `profile_path`

Directory where the profile log file is generated.
This parameter can be set by setting the environment variable `export HB_DNN_PROFILER_LOG_PATH=${path}` to view the OP and task scheduling time during model execution.
Generally, setting "--profile_path='.'" is sufficient, which means that the log file is generated in the current directory and the log file is named profiler.log.

- `thread_num`

Number of threads (parallelism), indicating the maximum number of tasks processed in parallel.
When testing latency, the value needs to be set to 1, so that there is no resource contention and the latency test is more accurate.
When testing throughput, it is recommended to set it to a value greater than 2 (number of BPU cores), adjust the number of threads to maximize BPU utilization, and make the throughput test more accurate.

```
  // Dual-core FPS
  hrt_model_exec perf --model_file xxx.bin --thread_num 8 --core_id 0
  // Latency
  hrt_model_exec perf --model_file xxx.bin --thread_num 1 --core_id 1
```
