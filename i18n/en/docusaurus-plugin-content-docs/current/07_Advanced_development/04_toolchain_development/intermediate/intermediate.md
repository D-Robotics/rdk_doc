# 7.4.3.3 Advanced guide

This guide is intended for users who are already familiar with the content of the D-Robotics Beginner's Guide. It mainly introduces the principles and step-by-step instructions for post-training quantization PTQ methods in the D-Robotics algorithm toolchain, model operator support instructions, and embedded application development instructions for model on-board operation.
If you are using the D-Robotics algorithm toolchain for the first time, it is recommended that you jump to the [Beginner's Guide](../beginner.md) section for learning.
