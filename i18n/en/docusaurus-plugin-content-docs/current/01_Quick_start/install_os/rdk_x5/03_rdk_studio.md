# 1.2.3.3 Using the RDK Studio Tool

## SD Card Flashing

The RDK Studio tool provides system flashing functionality and supports device connection and management. It is compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS platforms. For detailed steps, refer to [Flashing the System Using RDK Studio](../../09_RDK_Studio/04_flashing.md).

### On-Board SD Card Flashing

Insert the SD card into the development board, connect the USB Type-C cable to your PC, press and hold the Sleep button (located next to the headphone jack), power on the development board, and wait for 5 seconds until the board enters flashing mode.

Your PC will recognize the SD card as a USB drive. Then, follow the instructions in [Flashing the System Using RDK Studio](../../09_RDK_Studio/04_flashing.md) to complete the system flashing process.
