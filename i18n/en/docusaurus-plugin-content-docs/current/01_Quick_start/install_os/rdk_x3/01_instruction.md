# 1.2.1.1 Flashing Instructions


:::warning Notes

- Do not plug or unplug any devices while powered, except for USB, HDMI, and Ethernet cables.
- The Type-C USB port on the RDK X3 is for power supply only.
- The RDK X3 development board requires a power adapter that supports **5V/3A**. It is recommended to use the power adapter model listed in the [Basic Accessories List](../../../07_Advanced_development/01_hardware_development/rdk_x3/accessory.md).
- Do not power the development board via a computer's USB port, as insufficient power may cause abnormal behaviors such as **unexpected shutdowns or repeated reboots**.
