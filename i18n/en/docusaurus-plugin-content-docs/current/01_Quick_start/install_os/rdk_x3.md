</TabItem><TabItem value="x3md" label="RDK X3 Module">

The RDK X3 Module supports booting the system from two modes: eMMC and SD card:

- **Using SD card**: If you want to burn the system to an SD card (not booting from eMMC mode), follow the same steps as RDK X3 for burning the system.
- **Using eMMC**: You need to use the D-Robotics `hbupdate` tool. (**This method is mainly described below**)

The `hbupdate` tool supports two versions: Windows and Linux, which start with `hbupdate_win64` and `hbupdate_linux` respectively. The tool download link is: [hbupdate](https://archive.d-robotics.cc/downloads/en/hbupdate/).

:::tip Note

  - Extract the compressed tool package, and do not include **spaces, Chinese characters, special characters**, etc. in the extraction path.
  - The tool communicates with the RDK X3 module through the USB port, so you need to install the USB driver in advance. See the following description for specific steps.
:::

1. For PCs using the Windows system, before using the flashing tool, you need to confirm whether the fastboot driver program has been installed. Please follow the steps below to check:

   1. Ground the `Boot` pin of the RDK X3 carrier board using a jumper cap. Refer to the figure below for the pin position.

### Start the system

<Tabs groupId="rdk-type">
<TabItem value="x3" label="RDK X3">

First, keep the development board powered off, then insert the prepared memory card into the Micro SD card slot of the development board, and connect the development board to a monitor using an HDMI cable. Finally, power on the development board. The default environment configuration will be performed when the system starts up for the first time. The entire process takes about 45 seconds, and after the configuration is completed, the Ubuntu system desktop will be displayed on the monitor.

:::tip Explanation of Development Board Indicator Lights

* **<font color='Red'>Red</font>** indicator light: When it is on, it indicates normal hardware power-on.
* **<font color='Green'>Green</font>** indicator light: When it is on, it indicates that the system is booting up. When it is off or flashing, it indicates that the system booting process is complete.

If there is no display output on the development board for a long time (more than 2 minutes) after power-on, it means that the development board failed to start. In this case, users can check the system status through the indicator lights using the following methods:

* **<font color='Green'>Green light</font>** stays on: It indicates that the system failed to start. Users can check if the power adapter meets the requirements and try to remake the system image.
* **<font color='Green'>Green light</font>** is off or flashing: It indicates that the system has started successfully, but the display service failed to start. Users need to confirm if the connected display meets the specification requirements.

<TabItem value="x3md" label="RDK X3 Module">

RDK X3 Module supports two modes of system startup: eMMC mode and SD card mode.

- If the eMMC on the module does not have a system image burned, you can insert an SD card with the system image to the carrier board to start the system from the SD card.

- If the eMMC on the module already has a system image burned, you can switch between eMMC and SD card startup by following these steps:

   1. By default, the system starts up from the eMMC.

   2. To disable eMMC booting and switch to SD card startup, log into the system and execute the following command to remove the boot flag from the second partition of eMMC, then restart the system for the change to take effect:

   ```
   sudo parted /dev/mmcblk0 set 2 boot off
   sudo reboot
   ```

   3. In uboot, you will find that there is no boot partition on the eMMC and it looks for the boot partition on the SD card. The system is booted from the SD card. After logging into the system, you can execute the `mount` command to see that the root file system is mounted on the second partition of the SD card, and the config partition also uses the first partition of the SD card.

   ```
   /dev/mmcblk2p2 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered) 
   /dev/mmcblk2p1 on /boot/config type vfat
   ```

- To switch back to eMMC startup from SD card startup:

   When the system is started from the SD card and the system has already been burned to the eMMC, execute the following command to restore the eMMC startup. Restart the system for the change to take effect.
   ```
  sudo parted /dev/mmcblk0 set 2 boot on
  sudo reboot
  ```
