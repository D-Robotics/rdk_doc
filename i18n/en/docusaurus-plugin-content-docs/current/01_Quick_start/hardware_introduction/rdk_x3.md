The RDK X3 Module carrier board provides a set of control IO interfaces (Interface 13). Users can use jumper caps to short the corresponding pins to achieve control over various functional modes of the core module. The pin functions are defined as follows:

| Pin Number | Pin Name | Function Description                             | Usage                                      |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1          | BOOT     | Used to enter fastboot flashing mode            | Short the jumper cap to ground and power on |
| 2          | GL_EN    | Used to turn off the input power of the board   | Short the jumper cap to ground             |
| 3          | R_PG     | Used to indicate the working status of the board | High level indicates normal operation      |
| 4          | W_EN     | Used to turn off Wi-Fi function                  | Short the jumper cap to ground to turn off Wi-Fi, restart the system to recover |
| 5          | BT_EN    | Used to turn off Bluetooth function              | Short the jumper cap to ground to turn off Bluetooth, restart the system to recover |
| 6          | RXD2     | Serial UART2 receive signal                      | Serial UART2 receive signal                 |
| 7          | TXD2     | Serial UART2 transmit signal                     | Serial UART2 receive signal                 |
| 8          | GND      | Ground                                          | GND                                        |

## IO Level Switching Interface

<Tabs groupId="rdk-type">
<TabItem value="x3" label="RDK X3">

This interface is not available.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="x3md" label="RDK X3 Module">

The RDK X3 Module carrier board provides the IO level switching function for controlling the 40-pin header level mode, which supports two levels: 1.8V and 3.3V.

The interface signals from top to bottom are 3.3V, VREF, 1.8V, as shown in the following figure:

![image-x3-md-vref](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/07_Advanced_development/01_hardware_development/rdk_x3_module/image/rdk_x3_module/image-x3-md-vref.png)

It is important to note that **this interface cannot be left unconnected, otherwise the core module will not be able to start up due to power supply abnormalities**.

:::caution When switching levels, please strictly follow the steps below.
By default, the firmware of the core module of RDK X3 Module and the level configuration of the carrier board are set to 3.3V. If you need to switch the IO level, please follow the steps below:

1. Download the boot firmware that supports the 1.8V level configuration from the [firmware download address](https://archive.d-robotics.cc/downloads/en/miniboot/).
2. Use the official programming tool `hbupdate` to update the boot firmware of the core board. For detailed instructions, please refer to [Image Flash](/install_os).
3. Power off the device, connect the `vref` and `1.8V` signals using a jumper cap, and then power on again.
