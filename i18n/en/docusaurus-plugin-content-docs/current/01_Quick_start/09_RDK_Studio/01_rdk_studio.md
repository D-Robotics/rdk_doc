# 1.9.1 Introduction to RDK Studio

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';

```

RDK Studio is a user-friendly development tool for the RDK robotics development platform. It helps developers quickly understand and master the core capabilities of RDK, enabling "5-minute algorithm solution demos." Building on this, RDK Studio also supports developers in smoothly expanding demo solutions into complete, iterable application solutions, accelerating the entire process from learning and validation to actual development.
