# 1.4 Remote Login

This chapter is intended to introduce users who need to remotely access the development board through their personal computer (PC) on how to remotely login via serial port and network (VNC, SSH) methods.

:::tip

Before remote login via network, the development board needs to be connected to the network via wired Ethernet or wireless WiFi, and the IP address needs to be configured:

- Wired Ethernet: The development board defaults to static IP mode. For the IP address, refer to the [Network Status Confirmation](#network-status-confirmation) section.
- Wireless WiFi: The development board's IP address is generally assigned by the router and can be viewed in the device command line using the `ifconfig` command for the wlan0 network.

## Serial Port Login{#login_uart}


Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYV5nw_PDMw&list=PLSxjn4YS2IuFUWcLGj2_uuCfLYnNYw6Ld&index=16

Before using serial port login, it is necessary to confirm that the serial port cable of the development board is correctly connected to the computer. Refer to the [Serial Port Debugging](/hardware_introduction) chapter to verify the serial connection.

Serial port login requires a PC terminal tool. The commonly used tools are `PuTTy`, `MobaXterm`, etc. Users can select their terminal tool according to their own preferences, as the port configuration process is similar for different tools. Below is an example with `MobaXterm` to explain the process of creating a new serial port connection:

- When the USB-to-Serial adapter is first plugged into the computer, the serial port driver needs to be installed. After the driver is installed, the Device Manager can recognize the serial port board port normally, as shown in the figure below:  
![image-20220416105939067](../../../../../static/img/01_Quick_start/image/remote_login/image-20220416105939067.png)

- Open the `MobaXterm` tool, click `Session`, and then select `Serial`.

- Configure the port number, for example, `COM7`. The actual serial port number used depends on the serial port number recognized by the PC.

- Set the serial port configuration parameters as follows:
  
  | Configuration Item    | Parameter Value |
  | --------------------- | -------------- |
  | Baud rate             | 921600         |
  | Data bits             | 8              |
  | Parity                | None           |
  | Stop bits             | 1              |
  | Flow Control          | None           |
  
- Click `OK`, enter the username: `root`, password: `root` to log in to the device  
![image-Uart-Login](../../../../../static/img/01_Quick_start/image/remote_login/image-Uart-Login.gif)

At this point, you can use the `ifconfig` command to query the IP address of the development board, where eth0 and wlan0 represent the wired and wireless networks respectively:
```bash
root@ubuntu:~# ifconfig
eth0: flags=4163<UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST>  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.10  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255

The IP addresses corresponding to different versions of the images are as follows:

| Board Series     | Image Version                  | Ethernet Port IP Address                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| X3               | Less than or equal to 2.0.0    | 192.168.1.10/24                                   |
| X3               | Greater than or equal to 2.1.0 | 192.168.127.10/24                                 |

Before using remote login, it is necessary to confirm that the computer and development board are connected correctly.

Configure the IP address of the computer to be on the same subnet as the development board. For example, the development board: `192.168.1.10` and the computer: `192.168.1.100`. Assigning an IP address depends on the Operating System of the computer. Taking the WIN10 system as an example, the method to modify the static IP of the computer is as follows:

![image-20220416110242445](../../../../../static/img/01_Quick_start/image/remote_login/image-20220416110242445.png)

If you want to configure the wired network of the development board to obtain IP dynamically via DHCP mode, please refer to the [Wired Network](../02_System_configuration/01_network_blueteeth.md) chapter for configuration.

To confirm that the connection is working, execute `ping 192.168.1.10` from the computer (change the command to the IP address of the development board). If the `ping` command receives responses, then the connection is working; otherwise, check the network configurations are correct, and that the network firewall of the computer is turned off.

## VNC Login

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwi7O2XBKs&list=PLSxjn4YS2IuFUWcLGj2_uuCfLYnNYw6Ld&index=12

This section is for users using the Ubuntu Desktop system version, and it explains how to use "VNC Viewer" to achieve remote desktop login. "VNC Viewer" is a graphical desktop sharing software that allows you to remotely log in and control the desktop of the device on your computer. With this software, you can preview the system desktop of the development board on your computer screen and use your computer's mouse and keyboard for remote operation. By using VNC Viewer, you can achieve the same effect as local operation on the development board. You can download VNC Viewer from the following link: [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/).

**Connect to the Development Board**  
Currently, VNC supports two connection methods: direct connection and cloud connection. Users can choose according to their own needs. This article recommends using the direct connection method. The connection steps are as follows:- Enter the IP address of the input device, for example: 192.168.127.10

![image-20220610160658103](../../../../../static/img/01_Quick_start/image/remote_login/image-20220610160658103.png)

- After entering the IP address, press Enter, a prompt for an unencrypted connection will appear, click `Continue`  
![image-20220610160715916](../../../../../static/img/01_Quick_start/image/remote_login/image-20220610160715916.png)

- Enter the password `sunrise`, check `Remember password`, and click `OK` to connect  
![image-20220610160928136](../../../../../static/img/01_Quick_start/image/remote_login/image-20220610160928136.png)

## SSH Login {#ssh}
In addition to VNC login for remote desktop, you can also connect to the development board via SSH. The following steps describe how to create SSH connections using terminal software and terminal command line methods.

### Terminal Software
Commonly used terminal tools include `PuTTy`, `MobaXterm`, etc. Users can choose according to their own preferences. The configuration process for different tools is similar. The following example shows how to create a new SSH connection using `MobaXterm`:

1. Open the `MobaXterm` tool, click on `Session`, then select `SSH`.
2. Enter the development board IP address, for example: `192.168.1.10`.
3. Select `specify username`, enter `sunrise`.
4. After clicking OK, enter the username (sunrise) and password (sunrise) to complete the login.

![image-Network-Login](../../../../../static/img/01_Quick_start/image/remote_login/image-Network-Login.gif)

### Command Line on PC
Users can also use the command line to log in via SSH. The steps are as follows:

1. Open the terminal window and enter the SSH login command, for example: `ssh sunrise@192.168.1.10`.
2. A connection confirmation prompt will appear, enter YES.
3. Enter the password (sunrise) to complete the login.

## Setting Up a Local Area Network

To maintain a serial connection for the login steps mentioned earlier and to access the local area network, you can use the following commands:

```bash
sudo nmcli device wifi rescan
sudo nmcli device wifi list
sudo wifi_connect "SSID" "PASSWD"
```

After successfully executing these commands, you should see a message starting with `successfully xxx`.

Finally, on the board side, you can use `ifconfig` to obtain the board's IP address. Once you have the IP address, you can disconnect the serial cable and use the [SSH login method](#ssh) to remotely connect with the IP address you just obtained.
