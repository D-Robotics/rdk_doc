# 2.2 srpi-config Configuration Tool User Guide

:::info Note
The `srpi-config` configuration tool is only applicable to the `RDK X3` and `RDK X3 Module` development boards and is not suitable for the `RDK Ultra` development board.
:::

## Introduction

`srpi-config` is a system configuration tool. To open the configuration tool, type the following command in the command line:

```
sudo srpi-config
```

> `sudo` is a command for privilege management. It is necessary to enter it here in order to have root privileges for configuration management. The default sunrise account does not have permission to modify system files.

If you are using a desktop system, you can find the `RDK Configuration` application in the menu for configuration. It will also open a configuration terminal similar to the image above.

- **Peripheral bus config**
 
  Enable/disable SPI, I2C, Serial Port, I2S and other interfaces on the 40-pin interface. This configuration directly modifies the `status` of the corresponding bus in the device tree file and takes effect after reboot.
  [X5] 
  X5 has added a PWM interface;
  In the table below, each row of interfaces uses the same pins and can only have one function in effect. When all interfaces in a row are dsiable, the pins are gpio function pins


  | fun1 | fun2 | 
| ---- | ---- |
| serial3 | i2c5 |
| i2c0 | pwm2 |
| spi2 | pwm0 |
| spi2 | pwm1 |
| i2c1 | pwm3 |

  Use this option to configure the common size of ION memory.

> ION memory is a physical memory space reserved for the BPU, image, and video multimedia functions. The default configuration size is 672MB. If you need to run large algorithm models or decode multiple videos at the same time, adjust the memory size according to specific needs.

## Localisation Options

Localisation options provide the following choices: local language, time zone, and keyboard layout.

![image-20231123105018338](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/02_System_configuration/image/srpi-config/image-20231123105018338.png)

  Select a locale, such as configuring Chinese environment `zh_CN.UTF-8`. Restart to take effect.

- **Time Zone**

  Select your local time zone, starting from the region, for example, Asia, and then choose a city, like Shanghai. Type a letter to jump to that point in the alphabet.

- **Keyboard**

  Reading all keyboard types may take a long time to display. Changes usually take effect immediately but may require a restart.

## Advanced Options

Advanced options allow you to configure disk expansion, network proxy settings, and more.

- **Expand Filesystem**

  This option expands the installation to fill the entire TF card, providing more space for the file system.

> If the system is copied from another system that has already been initialized and configured, the capacity of the `TF` card may not be automatically adjusted to the current TF card. Use this feature to conveniently complete the expansion.

- **Network Proxy Settings**

  Configure the network proxy settings.

- **Boot Order**

  The RDK X3 module supports booting the system from eMMC and SD cards. This option is used to switch the boot mode.
