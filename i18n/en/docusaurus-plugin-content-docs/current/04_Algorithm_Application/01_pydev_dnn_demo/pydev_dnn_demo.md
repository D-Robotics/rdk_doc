# 4.1.1 Model Inference Examples

In this chapter, the `hobot_dnn` model inference library in D-Robotics's Python language will be demonstrated through example programs for static image inference, USB camera video stream inference, and MIPI camera video stream inference. The operations of model loading, data preprocessing, and model inference in the library will be introduced. The example code and data are stored in the `/app/pydev_demo/` directory. Users can refer to the code while reading the documentation for a better understanding of the examples.
