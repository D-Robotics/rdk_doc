# 4.2.4 Model Inference API


## hbDNNInfer()


**【Function Prototype】**  

``int32_t hbDNNInfer(hbDNNTaskHandle_t *taskHandle, hbDNNTensor **output, const hbDNNTensor *input, hbDNNHandle_t dnnHandle, hbDNNInferCtrlParam *inferCtrlParam)``

**【Description】** 

Execute an inference task based on the input parameters. The caller can use the returned ``taskHandle`` across functions and threads.

**【Parameters】**

- [out]     ``taskHandle``          Pointer to the task handle.
- [in/out]  ``output``              Output of the inference task.
- [in]      ``input``               Input of the inference task.
- [in]      ``dnnHandle``           Pointer to the DNN handle.
- [in]      ``inferCtrlParam``      Parameters to control the inference task.

**【Return Type】** 

- Returns ``0`` if the API is executed successfully, otherwise it fails.

:::info Note

  When using this interface to submit a task, the ``taskHandle`` should be set to ``nullptr`` in advance, unless it is to append a task to the specified ``taskHandle`` (i.e., using the ``inferCtrlParam::more`` function).

  Up to 32 model tasks are supported at the same time.

  For batch models, it is allowed to set the memory address of input tensors separately. For example, if the input validShape/alignedShape of the model is [4, 3, 224, 224], you can allocate four hbDNNTensors, and set the validShape/alignedShape of each hbDNNTensor as [1, 3, 224, 224] to store the data of each batch. When the model has multiple inputs, the order of ``input`` should be input0[batch0], input0[batch1], ..., inputn[batch0], inputn[batch1], ....

**【Function Prototype】**  

``int32_t hbDNNRoiInfer(hbDNNTaskHandle_t *taskHandle, hbDNNTensor **output, const hbDNNTensor *input, hbDNNRoi *rois, int32_t roiCount, hbDNNHandle_t dnnHandle, hbDNNInferCtrlParam *inferCtrlParam)``

**【Description】** 

Execute an ROI inference task based on the input parameters. The caller can use the returned ``taskHandle`` across functions and threads.

**[Return Type]**

- Returns ``0`` if the API is executed successfully, otherwise it fails.

:::info Note

  If using **RDK X3**, follow these rules:
  | This interface supports batch processing, assuming the number of data batches to be inferred is ``batch``, and the number of model inputs is ``input_count``, where the number of input sources for the resizer is ``resizer_count``.
  | Prepare input parameter ``input``: The range of the array index of ``input`` for the i-th ``batch`` is `[i * input\_count`, `(i + 1) * input\_count)，i=[0,batch)`.
  | Prepare input parameter ``rois``: Each input source for the resizer should match a roi. The range of the array index of ``rois`` for the i-th ``batch`` is `[i * resizer\_count`, `(i + 1) * resizer\_count)，i=[0,batch)`. The order of rois in each batch should be consistent with the order of the inputs.
  | Limit on the number of ``batch``: The range should be [1, 255].

  Model Limitations: The compilation parameter ``input_source`` of the model needs to be set to ``resizer`` during compilation, and the h*w of the model should be less than 18432.

  When submitting a task using this interface, the ``taskHandle`` should be set to ``nullptr`` in advance, unless it is appending a task to the specified ``taskHandle`` (i.e. using the ``inferCtrlParam::more`` function).

  The ``left`` and ``top`` values of the ``roi`` must be even, while the ``right`` and ``bottom`` values must be odd.

  The size of the ``roi`` must satisfy the following requirements: `16 <= width < 256`, `16 <= height < 256`.

  The scaling range is `0.5 < roi / src <= 8`.

  Currently, up to 32 model tasks can exist simultaneously.

  API Example: Please refer to the ``roi_infer.sh`` instructions in [Model Inference DNN API Usage Example Documentation](../../07_Advanced_development/04_toolchain_development/intermediate/runtime_sample#model-inference-dnn-api-usage-examples) for more details.

  Model Limitations: During the model conversion, set the compilation parameter input_source to `{'input_name': 'resizer'}` to generate a resizer model. For specific parameter configuration details, refer to the introduction in [PTQ Quantization Principles and Steps for Model Conversion](../../07_Advanced_development/04_toolchain_development/intermediate/ptq_process#model-conversion).

  ![resizer](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/04_Algorithm_Application/02_cdev_dnn_api/image/cdev_dnn_api/resizer.png)

  Currently, NV12 data with multiple inputs is also supported. The commonly used output sizes (HxW) of the resizer are: 128x128, 128x64, 64x128, 160x96.

:::info Note

  If using **RDK Ultra**, follow these rules:

- ``input_count``: Number of model input branches
- ``output_count``: Number of model output branches
- ``resizer_count``: Number of resizer input-source branches in the model (≤input_count). When the model processes a batch of data, one resizer input-source branch handles one roi.
- ``roiCount``: Total number of rois, its value is ``batch * resizer_count``
- ``data_batch``: The number of data batches that the model needs to infer, its value is ``roiCount / resizer_count``
- ``model_batch``: The batch size used internally by the model, i.e., the batch_size input to the model during inference. D-Robotics Toolchain supports compiling the model as a batch model.

Input/Output Example Explanation:

Taking a more complex multi-input model as an example, let's assume the model has 3 input branches (2 resizer inputs, 1 ddr input) and 1 output branch, and is compiled with ``batch=2``. The model needs to process a total of 3 batches of data, with 6 rois in total (i.e., 2 rois per data batch). Given the following information:

- ``input_count`` = 3
- ``output_count`` = 1
- ``resizer_count`` = 2
- ``roiCount`` = 6
- ``data_batch`` = 3
- ``model_batch`` = 2

So for model inference, these three batches of data need to prepare ``input_count * data_batch = 9`` input-tensors with independent addresses.

Assuming the static information of the model input/output is as follows:

- Model Input (model_info):

  - tensor_0_resizer: [2, 3, 128, 128]
  - tensor_1_resizer: [2, 3, 256, 256]
  - tensor_2_ddr: [2, 80, 1, 100]

- Model Output (model_info):

  - tensor_out: [2, 100, 1, 56]

Then the dynamic information of the model during inference is:

- Model Input (input_tensors):

  - [1x3x128x128, 1x3x256x256, 1x80x1x100, 1x3x128x128, 1x3x256x256, 1x80x1x100, 1x3x128x128, 1x3x256x256, 1x80x1x100]

- Model Output (output_tensors):

  - [4x100x1x56]

Here, because ``model_batch = 2``, the underlying BPU can handle 2 batches of data in a single execution. And because ``data_batch = 3``, the highest dimension of the output_tensor is calculated using the formula ``ceil[(data_batch) / model_batch] * model_batch``, which is always a multiple of ``model_batch``. This is also a hardware instruction requirement of the BPU, and any missing inputs will be automatically ignored during computation.

Interface Limitations Explanation:

- Regarding the ``batch`` number limitation: its range should be [1, 255].
- When using this interface to submit a task, ``taskHandle`` should be set to ``nullptr`` in advance, unless it is appending a task to a specific ``taskHandle`` (i.e., using the ``inferCtrlParam::more`` functionality).
- The roi size requirement is: `2 <= width <= 4096`, `2 <= height <= 4096`.
- The original image size requirement is: `1 <= W <= 4096`, `16 <= stride <= 131072`, and ``stride`` must be a multiple of 16.
- The output size requirement is: `2 <= Wout`, `2 <= Hout`.
- The roi scaling factor limit is: `0 <= step <= 262143`, where the step is calculated using the formula: `step = ((src_len - 1)*65536 + (dst_len - 1)/2)/(dst_len - 1)`, where src_len is the W or H of the roi and dst_len is the required W or H of the model.
- Up to 32 model tasks can exist simultaneously.
