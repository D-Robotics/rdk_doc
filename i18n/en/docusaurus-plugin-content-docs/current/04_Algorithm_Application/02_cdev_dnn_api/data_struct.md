```
Tensor shape. For example, a 224x224 BGR color space image has ``numDimensions=4``, if the layout is NHWC,
the ``dimensionSize`` array would sequentially store the image's ``Number=1``, ``Height=224``, ``Width=224``, and ``Channel=3``.

``hbDNNQuantiShift``
```C
    typedef struct {
      int32_t shiftLen;
      uint8_t *shiftData;
    } hbDNNQuantiShift;
```
Shift/De-Shift Data for Quantization/Dequantization.

**For Input:**
If a floating-point data point ``data[i]`` is collected, with its corresponding shift data being ``shift[i]``, the inference data fed into the model would be: `data[i] * (1 << shift[i])` rounded to the nearest integer;

**For Output:**
If the inference result is ``data[i]`` and its corresponding shift data is ``shift[i]``, then the final inference result would be: `data[i] / (1 << shift[i])`.

:::caution Note
Here, ``shiftLen`` is determined by the data ``data`` based on either the `per-axis` or `per-tensor` quantization/dequantization method.
When the data ``data`` is quantized/dequantized using the "per-tensor" method, ``shiftLen`` equals ``1``, and in this case, the value of ``quantizeAxis`` need not be considered; otherwise, it equals the size of the ``quantizeAxis`` dimension in the data ``data``.
:::

+ **Members**

    | Member Name | Description |
    |---------------|--------------------|
    | ``shiftLen``  | Length of the shift data. |
    | ``shiftData`` | Start address of the shift data. |

``hbDNNQuantiScale``
```C
    typedef struct {
      int32_t scaleLen;
      float *scaleData;
      int32_t zeroPointLen;
      int8_t *zeroPointData;
    } hbDNNQuantiScale;
```
Scaling/De-scaling Data for Quantization/Dequantization.

**For Input:**
If a floating-point data point ``data[i]`` is collected, with its corresponding scaling data as ``scale[i]`` and zero-point offset data as ``zeroPoint[i]``, the inference data fed into the model would be: `g((data[i] / scale[i]) + zeroPoint[i])`, where `g(x) = clip(nearbyint(x))` using fesetround(FE_TONEAREST) rounding method, truncated to: U8: `g(x) ∈ [0, 255]`, S8: `g(x) ∈ [-128, 127]`;

**For Output:**
If the inference result is ``data[i]`` with its corresponding scaling data as ``scale[i]`` and zero-point offset data as ``zeroPoint[i]``, the final inference result would be: `(data[i] - zeroPoint[i]) * scale[i]`.

:::caution Note
Here, ``scaleLen`` is determined by the data ``data`` based on either the `per-axis` or `per-tensor` quantization/dequantization method.
When the data ``data`` is quantized/dequantized using the "per-tensor" method, ``scaleLen`` equals ``1``, and in this case, the value of ``quantizeAxis`` need not be considered; otherwise, it equals the size of the ``quantizeAxis`` dimension in the data ``data``. The length of ``zeroPointLen`` remains consistent with that of ``scaleLen``.

``hbDNNQuantiType``
```C
    typedef enum {
      NONE, 
      SHIFT,
      SCALE,
    } hbDNNQuantiType;
```
Quantization/Dequantization Types for Fixed-Point Floating-Point Conversion.

``NONE`` represents no processing required for the data; the parameters for quantization/dequantization of type ``SHIFT`` are stored in the ``hbDNNQuantiShift`` structure, while those for type ``SCALE`` are stored in the ``hbDNNQuantiScale`` structure.

+ **Members**

    | Member Name     | Description       |
    |----------------|---------------------|
    | ``NONE``        | No quantization.    |

```C
    typedef struct {
      hbDNNTensorShape validShape;

      int32_t alignedByteSize;
      int32_t stride[HB_DNN_TENSOR_MAX_DIMENSIONS];
    } hbDNNTensorProperties;
```
Information about Tensors.

In this context, when obtained from the model information, ``alignedShape`` refers to the tensor's shape after alignment; after preparing input data, ``alignedShape`` must be consistent with the actual input shape of the tensor.

    | Member Name       | Description         |
    |--------------------|-----------------------|

    | ``tensorType``      | Type of the tensor. |
    | ``shift``           | Quantization shift. |
    | ``scale``           | Quantization scale. |
    | ``quantiType``      | Quantization type. |
    | ``quantizeAxis``    | Quantization axis, effective only for per-axis quantization. |
    | ``alignedByteSize`` | Memory size of the tensor's aligned content. |
    | ``stride``          | Stride for each dimension in the tensor's validShape. |

:::info Remark
The tensor information obtained through the interface is as required by the model, but you can modify certain tensor information according to your actual input. Currently, only the information of ``alignedShape`` and ``tensorType`` can be modified, and they must meet specific requirements.

  **``alignedShape``:**

  1. If you prepare input based on ``alignedShape``, there is no need to change ``alignedShape``.

  2. If you prepare input based on ``validShape``, you should change ``alignedShape`` to ``validShape``; internally, the inference library will perform padding operations on the data.

  **``tensorType``:**

  When inferring models with NV12 input, you can change the ``tensorType`` attribute of the tensor according to your situation to either ``HB_DNN_IMG_TYPE_NV12`` or ``HB_DNN_IMG_TYPE_NV12_SEPARATE``.

``hbDNNTaskPriority``
```C
    typedef enum {
      HB_DNN_PRIORITY_LOWEST = 0,
      HB_DNN_PRIORITY_HIGHEST = 255,
      HB_DNN_PRIORITY_PREEMP = HB_DNN_PRIORITY_HIGHEST,
    } hbDNNTaskPriority;
```
Configuration of Task Priority, providing default parameters.

``hbDNNTensor``

```C
typedef struct {
  hbSysMem sysMem[4];
  hbDNNTensorProperties properties;
} hbDNNTensor;
```

This structure defines a tensor used for storing input and output information. For tensors of type ``NV12_SEPARATE``, two ``hbSysMem`` elements are required, while all other types require one.

+ Members

    | Member Name  | Description                                   |
    |--------------|------------------------------------------------|
    | ``sysMem``     | Memory where the tensor data is stored.         |
    | ``properties`` | Information about the properties of the tensor. |

``hbDNNRoi``

```C
typedef struct {
  int32_t left;
  int32_t top;
  int32_t right;
  int32_t bottom;
} hbDNNRoi;
```

This structure represents a rectangular region of interest (ROI). The ROI spans from `W∈[left, right]` to `H∈[top, bottom]` in terms of pixel coordinates.

+ Members

    | Member Name | Description                                       |
    |-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
    | ``left``   | Pixel width coordinate of the top-left point.      |
    | ``top``    | Pixel height coordinate of the top-left point.     |
    | ``right``  | Pixel width coordinate of the bottom-right point.  |
    | ``bottom`` | Pixel height coordinate of the bottom-right point. |

``hbDNNInferCtrlParam``

```c
typedef struct {
  int32_t bpuCoreId;

  int32_t priority;
  int32_t more;
  int64_t customId;
  int32_t reserved1;
  int32_t reserved2;
} hbDNNInferCtrlParam;
```

This structure encapsulates control parameters for model inference. In this context, ``bpuCoreId`` and ``dspCoreId`` are used to control which BPU and DSP cores are utilized for model inference; however, X3 does not support DSP inference, so ``dspCoreId`` is just a placeholder. The ``more`` parameter is designed for scenarios involving batch processing of small models. If the user wants all tasks to finish before getting outputs, they should set ``more`` to ``0`` for the last task and ``1`` for preceding tasks, supporting up to 255 small model inferences, where a small model could be a resizer model with each ROI potentially treated as a separate small model. The ``customId`` parameter allows users to define their own priority level, such as timestamp or frame id, where a smaller value indicates higher priority. Priority order: priority > customId.

    | ``more``        | Whether there are subsequent tasks following this one.|
    | ``customId``   | Custom priority value defined by the user.           |
    | ``reserved1``  | Reserved field 1.                                    |

``hbSysMemFlushFlag``

```c
typedef enum {
  HB_SYS_MEM_CACHE_INVALIDATE = 1,
  HB_SYS_MEM_CACHE_CLEAN = 2
} hbSysMemFlushFlag;
```

This enumeration defines system memory and cache synchronization flags. There exists a cache between the CPU and memory, which can cause data discrepancies. To ensure that the most up-to-date data is always retrieved, we need to synchronize data between the cache and memory before and after CPU reads or writes. Before a CPU read, data from memory is updated into the cache. After a CPU write, data from the cache is updated back into memory.
