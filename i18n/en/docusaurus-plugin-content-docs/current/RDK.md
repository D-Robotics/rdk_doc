### Operating Temperature and Cooling Recommendations

#### Operating Temperature Range

- Recommended ambient temperature: **-20Â°C to 60Â°C**  
    Ensure the device operates within this range for stability and reliability.

#### Chip Thermal Characteristics

- Maximum chip junction temperature: **105Â°C**
- When the chip junction temperature exceeds **95Â°C**, the system will automatically throttle to reduce temperature, which may affect performance.

#### Cooling Design Recommendations

- **Development and Testing:** It is recommended to use heatsinks, RDK Case, and cooling fans for additional heat dissipation.
- **Productization:** Perform thorough thermal design evaluation and optimization based on the overall system environment to ensure the chip operates within a reasonable temperature range and avoid performance degradation or system issues due to overheating.
