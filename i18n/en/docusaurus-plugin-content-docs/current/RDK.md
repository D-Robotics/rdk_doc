### Operating Temperature and Thermal Recommendations

#### Operating Temperature Range

- Recommended ambient temperature: **-20째C to 60째C**  
    Ensure the device operates within this temperature range to maintain stability and reliability.

#### Chip Thermal Characteristics

- Maximum chip junction temperature: **105째C**
- When the chip junction temperature exceeds **95째C**, the system will automatically initiate frequency reduction to lower the temperature, which may affect performance.

#### Thermal Design Recommendations

- **Development and Testing Phase**: It is recommended to use heat sinks, the RDK Case, and cooling fans for additional thermal management.
- **Productization Phase**: Conduct thorough thermal design evaluation and optimization based on the overall system thermal environment. Ensure the chip operates within a reasonable temperature range under all usage scenarios to avoid performance degradation or system instability due to overheating.
