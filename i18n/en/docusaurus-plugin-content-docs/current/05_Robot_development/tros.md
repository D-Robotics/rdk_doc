The code of TogetheROS.Bot is hosted on GitHub under the D-Robotics organization link: [D-Robotics](https://github.com/D-Robotics).

## Communication
Communication is D-Robotics's optimized and extended communication component on ROS2 Foxy/Humble version.

Main Features include:

The blue sections indicate the modules optimized and added by D-Robotics, and the main features of TogetheROS.Bot are as follows:

- Provide "hobot_sensor" to adapt to commonly used robot sensors, saving development time and focusing on core competitiveness.
- Provide "hobot_dnn" to simplify on-board algorithm model inference and deployment, unlocking BPU computing power and lowering the threshold for intelligent algorithm usage.
- Provide "hobot_codec" to accelerate video encoding and decoding through a combination of software and hardware, saving CPU resources and improving parallel processing capability.
- Provide "hobot_cv" to enhance the performance of common computer vision operators through a combination of software and hardware, saving CPU resources and improving runtime efficiency.
- Provide "hobot Render" for web-based and HDMI dynamic visualization, real-time rendering of algorithm results (limited to web-based), facilitating display and debugging.
- Add "zero-copy" inter-process zero-copy communication mechanism to reduce data transmission latency and system resource consumption.
- Enhance middleware software debugging and performance tuning tools, improve problem localization efficiency, and facilitate system performance optimization.
- Fully compatible with ROS2 Foxy/Humble version, facilitating the reuse of ROS2 toolkits and speeding up prototype verification.
- Support minimal and modular pruning, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained embedded products as needed.

## Boxs
Boxs is an intelligent algorithm package launched by D-Robotics for robot manufacturers and developers based on TogetheROS.Bot. It aims to improve the efficiency of integrating and implementing robot intelligent algorithms based on the D-Robotics robot operating system.

- Image detection algorithms such as FCOS, YOLO, FasterRCNN, Efficientdet, Mobilenet_ssd;
- Image classification models such as Mobilenet
- Semantic segmentation models such as Unet
- Application algorithm models such as human detection and tracking, gesture recognition, human hand keypoint detection, monocular height network, monocular 3D detection, speech processing,VIO,etc.

## Apps
Apps are algorithm application examples developed based on the D-Robotics robot operating system's Communication and Boxs. They aim to establish a complete chain of image input, perception, strategy, etc., demonstrate application effects, and accelerate the development efficiency of customer demos.
