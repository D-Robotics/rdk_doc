# 5.4.4 Robot Follows the Human Body

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';
```

## Introduction

The app is used to control the robot to follow the movement of the human body. The app consists of MIPI image acquisition, body detection and tracking, body tracking strategy, image coding and decoding, and a web display interface. The workflow is shown in the following diagram:

![](https://rdk-doc.oss-cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/doc/img/05_Robot_development/04_apps/image/car_tracking/body_tracking_workflow.jpg)

The app is demonstrated using a virtual car in the PC-side Gazebo simulation environment, but the control commands can also be directly used to control a physical robot.

Code Repository:  (https://github.com/D-Robotics/body_tracking)

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | System | Function                  |
| ---------| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| RDK X3, RDK X3 Module, RDK X5  | Ubuntu 20.04  | Start MIPI/USB camera to capture images, perform body keypoints detection and body tracking, and display the tracking effect in Gazebo |

## Preparation

### RDK

1. RDK has been flashed with the  Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 system image provided by D-Robotics.

2. TogetheROS.Bot has been successfully installed on RDK.

3. MIPI or USB camera has been installed on RDK.

4. The PC used for RDK should be in the same network segment (either wired or connected to the same wireless network, with the first three parts of the IP address being consistent). The PC should have the following environment installed:

## Usage

### RDK

After running the app, the car motion control package will select the human body closest to the front of the car (with the largest width of the body detection box) as the tracking target. When the human body is far from the car, the car starts to move forward to approach the body and keeps it in front of the car.After the app is launched, the sensor will publish images and corresponding algorithm results, which can be rendered and displayed on the PC browser. (Enter http://IP:8000 in the browser, where IP is the IP address of the RDK).

Launch the simulation environment on the PC side:

<Tabs groupId="tros-distro">
<TabItem value="foxy" label="Foxy">

```shell
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="humble" label="Humble">

```shell
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

```shell
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo empty_world.launch.py
```

After successful launch, the car effect in the simulation environment is as follows:

## Result Analysis


The following information is outputted in the terminal when running on the RDK.

```text

[body_tracking-7] [WARN] [1653430535.220408576] [RobotCmdVelNode]: RobotCtl, angular: 0 0 0, linear: 0.3 0 0, pub twist ts: 1653430535220394
```

The above log captures a section of the output after the app is launched. Print the relevant configuration (TrackCfg param) first after startup. After detecting the human body, the car starts to enter a following state (tracking_sta value is 1) and moves forward at a speed of 0.3m/s (RobotCtl, angular: 0 0 0, linear: 0.3 0 0) to approach the human body.

Use the command `ros2 topic list`on PC,the topic is as belowï¼š

```shell
$ ros2 topic list
/camera_info
/cmd_vel
/hbmem_img04054242060426080500012020112713
/hobot_mono2d_body_detection
/image
/parameter_events
/rosout
```
Among them, `/image` is the image captured by the RDK from the MIPI sensor and encoded in JPEG format, `/hobot_mono2d_body_detection` is the algorithm message published by the RDK which contains the human body detection results, and `/cmd_vel` is the motion control command published by the RDK.

On the PC, using the `ros2 topic echo /cmd_vel` command on the terminal can view the motion control commands issued by RDK:

```shell
linear:
  x: 0.5
  y: 0.0
  z: 0.0
angular:
  x: 0.0
  y: 0.0
  z: -0.5
---
linear:x: 0.5
y: 0.0
z: 0.0
angular:
x: 0.0
y: 0.0
z: -0.5
---
```

In the PC simulation environment, the car follows the movement of the human body. The simulated car movement effect is as follows:
