Functionality changes:
- Based on TROS Foxy 2.1.3 version, adapted to Ubuntu 22.04 system and ROS2 Humble.

- `hobot_mipi_cam` node adds frame_ts_type configuration item, which supports realtime (used to calculate communication delay) and sensor (default, used for sensor timestamp synchronization) configuration parameters.
- Added `hobot_shm` node for configuring ROS2 zero-copy environment.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed compatibility issues introduced by compiler upgrade.
- Fixed the path dependency problem in the ROS2 pkg compiled on the board end.

## tros-foxy

### Version: 2.1.3

Functionality changes:

- The data type used for jpeg compressed images has been changed from `sensor_msgs::msg::Image` to the standard `sensor_msgs::msg::CompressedImage`. It supports using tools such as foxglove and ros2 rqt to view jpeg format images released by TROS. Involving the hobot_websocket, hobot_codec, hobot_image_publisher, hobot_usb_cam modules.

- The environment variable TROS_DISTRO representing the TROS distribution is introduced. After executing the `source /opt/tros/setup.bash`/`source /opt/tros/local_setup.bash` command, the value of the environment variable `TROS_DISTRO` is empty. The configuration file path used by hobot_codec, hobot_audio, hobot_mipi_cam, hobot_usb_cam and other modules has been changed from `/opt/tros/lib` to `/opt/tros/${TROS_DISTRO}/lib`.
