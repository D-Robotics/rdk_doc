# 5.5.3 Using Breakpad

## Background

Breakpad is a tool suite for recording crash information in applications, which is more powerful than the Linux core mechanism. It can be used to view crash information of applications that have been stripped of compiler debugging information. When a program crashes, the crash information is recorded in a compact "minidump" file and sent back to the server. It can generate C and C++ stack traces from these minidumps and symbol files. Breakpad is located in the tools folder of TogetheROS.Bot.

## Preparation

Breakpad is located in the code repository  (https://github.com/D-Robotics/breakpad.git), with the develop branch. The directory contains the bin, lib, includes, and other folders that have been cross-compiled and can run on the RDK, which include the breakpad tools, static libraries, header files, and other contents.

## Usage
### 1. Creating, compiling, and running the test program
Create a new test program named test.cpp in the Breakpad directory and compile it into an executable program named test, making sure to include the -g option. Create a new directory /tmp, and then run the executable program test.

```c++
//  test.cpp

//  Include the core Breakpad header file
#include "client/linux/handler/exception_handler.h"

//  Callback function when a crash occurs
static bool dumpCallback(const google_breakpad::MinidumpDescriptor& descriptor,
                          void* context, bool succeeded) {
  printf("Dump path: %s\n", descriptor.path());
  return succeeded;
}

//  Crash function
void crash() { volatile int* a = (int*)(nullptr); *a = 1; }

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
  //  Initialize the descriptor and set the coredump file path to /tmp
  google_breakpad::MinidumpDescriptor descriptor("/tmp");
  google_breakpad::ExceptionHandler eh(descriptor, NULL, dumpCallback, NULL,
                                        true, -1);
  crash();
  return 0;
}
```

```shell
root@ubuntu:~/cc_ws/tros_ws/src/tools/breakpad# g++ ./test.cpp -o test -g \
  -I ./include/breakpad/ \
  -L ./lib/ \
  -lbreakpad -lbreakpad_client -lpthreadroot@ubuntu:~/cc_ws/tros_ws/src/tools/breakpad# mkdir /tmp
root@ubuntu:~/cc_ws/tros_ws/src/tools/breakpad# ./test
Dump path: /tmp/4113ab89-7169-49df-963945b3-383e8364.dmp
Segmentation fault
```

### 2. Generate dump file using breakpad

Give execute permission to the program, and use the dump_syms tool to dump the symbols information of the executable program "test" to a file named "test.sym".

```shell
root@ubuntu:~/cc_ws/tros_ws/src/tools/breakpad# chmod +x ./bin/*
root@ubuntu:~/cc_ws/tros_ws/src/tools/breakpad# ./bin/dump_syms ./test > test.sym
```

View the first line of the test.sym file and create the related folders.

```shell
root@ubuntu:~/cc_ws/tros_ws/src/tools/breakpad# head -n1 test.sym
MODULE Linux arm64 3816BF7138E87673BEE70E2C86F5FAC80 test
root@ubuntu:~/cc_ws/tros_ws/src/tools/breakpad# mkdir -p ./symbols/test/3816BF7138E87673BEE70E2C86F5FAC80 
root@ubuntu:~/cc_ws/tros_ws/src/tools/breakpad# cp test.sym ./symbols/test/3816BF7138E87673BEE70E2C86F5FAC80 
```

Run the executable program "test" to generate a minidump.dmp file. Run the following command to get the program's stack trace information. Note that the .dmp filename may be different. Here, we use the dmp file generated in the first step.

```shell
root@ubuntu:~/cc_ws/tros_ws/src/tools/breakpad# ./bin/minidump_stackwalk /tmp/4113ab89-7169-49df-963945b3-383e8364.dmp ./symbols
```

### 3. Analysis

The output of the command in the previous step is shown below, which indicates that the program crashes at line 11 of test.cpp, which is expected.

## Summary

This chapter introduces how to use the breakpad framework to generate crash files and analyze stack information. The application initializes the breakpad by specifying the directory generated by the dump file and registering a callback function for crashes. Use the dump_syms tool of breakpad again to generate a symbol file and create a symbol directory. Finally, use the minidump_stackwalk tool to parse the dump file and analyze the stack information.
