## 4. Known Issues

### 4.1 Software Known Issues

- RDK Linux  
  - RTC YSN8130E is currently not supported in software  
  - Some Ubuntu applications crash under GPU acceleration due to page size mismatches  
  - The timestamp unit used in multi-channel CAN pass-through code differs from that used in the Main-Domain middleware, causing error logs in the middleware—however, data transmission remains unaffected  
- MCU SDK  
  - The MCU system currently has some stability issues  
  - BMI088 IMU on the MCU daughterboard is not yet supported in software  
  - Lockstep unlock is currently unsupported
