- CAN  
  - Supports extended frame transparent transmission  
  - Optimized timestamps, now uniformly in microseconds to meet performance measurement requirements  

## 3. Key Fixes

### 3.1 Root File System

- Improved stability of Ubuntu applications on the S100 platform  
- Fixed an issue where hobot-configs would overwrite netplan configuration  

### 3.2 Main-Domain Peripherals

#### 3.2.1 Camera

- Fixed timestamp jumps in camera synchronized frames caused by kernel RTC auto-update; kernel RTC auto-sync has been disabled  
- Fixed duplicate trigger timestamp issue with OVX3C module  
- Resolved linked-list issue caused by GDC buffer not being nullified after release  

#### 3.2.2 WiFi/Bluetooth

- Improved stability of WiFi and Bluetooth drivers  

### 3.3 MCU-Domain

- Fixed several stability issues  

## 4. Known Issues

### 4.1 Software Known Issues

- RDK Linux  
  - RTC YSN8130E is not yet supported in software  
  - Some Ubuntu applications crash under GPU acceleration due to page size mismatch  
  - Timestamp units in multi-channel CAN transparent transmission code differ from those in Main-Domain middleware, causing error logs in middleware—but data transmission remains unaffected  
  - When cold-booting without an HDMI cable connected, the RDK S100 desktop environment (GDM3) defaults to X11 rendering. Since S100 does not support GPU acceleration under X11, it falls back to CPU rendering, significantly increasing CPU usage. Users are advised to connect an HDMI display before powering on the device to avoid degraded rendering performance.  

- MCU SDK  
  - The MCU system currently has some stability issues  
  - BMI088 IMU on the MCU daughterboard is not yet supported in software  
  - Lockstep unlock functionality is currently unsupported  

## 5. Upgrade Instructions

### 5.1 Full Re-flash

Users can upgrade by flashing the complete image:

- Download image: [RDK_LNX_SDK V4.0.4-Beta](https://archive.d-robotics.cc/downloads/os_images/rdk_s100/RDKS100-V4.0.4-Beta/RDK_LNX_SDK/firmwares/product.zip)  
- Follow the instructions in section [1.2 System Flashing](../01_Quick_start/02_install_os/rdk_s100) to complete flashing  

### 5.2 Direct Upgrade

To preserve existing root file system modifications, users may upgrade as follows:

:::warning

This upgrade requires updating miniboot separately using a tool.

:::

- Download the new flashing tool: [D-Navigation V2.4.1](https://archive.d-robotics.cc/downloads/software_tools/download_tools/)  
- Download the latest image: [RDK_LNX_SDK V4.0.4-Beta](https://archive.d-robotics.cc/downloads/os_images/rdk_s100/RDKS100-V4.0.4-Beta/RDK_LNX_SDK/firmwares/product.zip)  
- Follow the basic setup instructions in the uboot/usb flashing section of [1.2 System Flashing](../01_Quick_start/02_install_os/rdk_s100)  
- Modify the following options in the above setup:  
  - Upgrade configuration: Partition selection  
    - Select only: miniboot_flash, miniboot_emmc  
- Reboot the device after the update completes  
- Run the following commands to fetch updated packages:

  ```bash
