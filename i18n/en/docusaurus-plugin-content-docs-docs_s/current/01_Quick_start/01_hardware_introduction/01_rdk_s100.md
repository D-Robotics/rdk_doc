:::

:::warning Safety Guidelines

To prevent product malfunction or damage, please adhere to the following:

1. During operation, do not expose the product to water or moisture, place it on conductive surfaces, or expose it to heat sources. Ensure reliable operation within normal ambient temperature ranges.
2. During assembly, avoid causing mechanical or electrical damage to printed circuit boards (PCBs) and connectors.
3. While powered on, avoid touching the PCB or device edges with bare hands to minimize the risk of electrostatic discharge (ESD) damage.

:::

:::info Note

For peripherals with independent external power supplies, power on the development board first, then power on the peripherals. If a peripheral is powered on before the S100 development board and backfeeds power into the mainboard, the development board may enter a protection state and fail to boot.

### DC Jack (J1)

:::info

Rated voltage: 20V, rated current: 10A. The S100 mainboard accepts input power from 12–20V DC. Use a power adapter with inner diameter 2.5mm and outer diameter 6mm to power the S100 system.

- Typical scenarios: 70W power supply recommended (12V@5.5A).
- Maximum load scenarios: 150W power supply recommended (20V@7.5A).

:::

### Automatic EXT CTRL Connector (J2)

The RDK S100 mainboard includes a 12-Pin Automatic EXT CTRL Connector, primarily serving the following purposes:

- Extends physical controls (flash switch, sleep button, reset button, and power switch) to the exterior for convenient manual operation after system integration.

:::info Note

1. The green LED indicates whether the mainboard’s minimal system has completed power-up; the orange LED indicates whether the Main Domain system is operating normally.
2. The 12-Pin Automatic EXT CTRL Connector may only be connected to circuits described in its functional specification. High-power loads are strictly prohibited.
3. When the system is in light sleep or deep sleep mode, VDD_AON_PERI_5V and DCIN_CONN remain powered, while VDD_PERI_3V3 is turned off. External daughterboards must include short-circuit protection to prevent abnormal power behavior due to shorts.
4. Maximum output current for VDD_AON_PERI_5V, DCIN_CONN, and VDD_PERI_3V3 is 50mA, 5mA, and 100mA, respectively.

:::

### Type-C (J16)

The USB Type-C port (J16) is intended solely for flashing and debugging—it is **not** a standard full-featured USB Type-C port. It provides the following functions:

- **Debug UART**: Two `CH340` chips convert the debug UARTs from both the Main Domain and MCU Domain of the core module into USB interfaces, enabling various debugging tasks. On first use, install the CH340 driver on your host computer by searching for "CH340 serial driver." Configure your serial terminal with the following settings:
  - Baud rate: 921600
  - Data bits: 8
  - Parity: None
  - Stop bits: 1
  - Flow control: None

- **USB Download Interface**: This port serves as a firmware download interface. For details, refer to [1.2 System Flashing](../02_install_os/rdk_s100.md).

#### Function Selection (SW6)  

On the 40-Pin Header, I2C5 and UART2 share pins. Additionally, the PCM0 interface is shared between the 40-Pin Header (J24) and the M.2 KEY E connector (J17), and can be switched using DIP switch SW6.  

:::info Recommendation  

For PCM0, if Bluetooth audio functionality from the Wi-Fi module is not required, set the DIP switch to the right position by default.
